Wethinkcode project called "Push Swap", which involves sorting numbers using a stack-based algorithm.

The Push Swap project is a popular programming challenge often found in coding schools like 42 and is aimed at testing algorithmic problem-solving, stack manipulation, and optimization skills. The challenge consists of sorting a set of numbers using two stacks and a limited set of operations. The goal is to sort the numbers in as few moves as possible.

# Concept Overview
You have two stacks: stack_a and stack_b. The numbers to be sorted are initially placed in stack_a, while stack_b starts empty. The challenge is to sort all the numbers in stack_a in ascending order, using a predefined set of operations, while trying to minimize the number of moves. No direct sorting methods (like bubble sort or quicksort) are allowed, and you have to rely on stack operations only.
