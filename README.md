Wethinkcode project called "Push Swap", which involves sorting numbers using a stack-based algorithm.

The Push Swap project is a popular programming challenge often found in coding schools like 42 and is aimed at testing algorithmic problem-solving, stack manipulation, and optimization skills. The challenge consists of sorting a set of numbers using two stacks and a limited set of operations. The goal is to sort the numbers in as few moves as possible.
